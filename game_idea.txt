* Hitler is the playable character.
* Gameplay can be walking through a level avoiding, befooling, distracting and sometimes killing some guards.
	The downside is that it will require lots of planning and also lots of modelling and level design.
	Time consuming.
	But it will look better.
* It is also possible to create some basic gameplay mechanic with some procedurally generated levels.
